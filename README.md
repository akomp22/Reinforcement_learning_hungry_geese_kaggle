# Reinforcment learning

Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms for the hungry geese (snake) game in the Kaggle competition. Two approaches are used:

1. Q learning with prioritized experience replay (efficient implementation through a segment tree).
2. Actor critic approach.

In both cases, the inception CNN with was used as a function approximator.

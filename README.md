# Reinforcment_learning_hungry_geese_kagglr

Implementation of reinforcment learning algorithms for the hungry geese (snake) game in Kaggle competition.
Two approaches are used:
1. Q learning with priotarised expirience replay (efitient implimentation through a segment tree). 
2. Actor critic approach.

In both cases the inception CNN with was used as function approximator.
